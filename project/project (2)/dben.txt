Gyeongbokgung
The Gyeongbokgung Palace(景福宮) is the court palace of the Joseon Dynasty in Sejongno, Seoul, Korea. It was founded in 1395 (4th year of Taejo). 'Gyeongbok' means that the king, his descendants, and all the people are blessed to enjoy the great blessings of Taipingong Sungdae. It is surrounded by Naksan and Inwangsan on the left and right. In 1592, after the disastrous burning of the Japanese invasion in 1592, he gave up the task to Changdeokgung. In 1865 (2nd year of King Gojong) In the period of Japanese occupation, many of the monuments were damaged such as the building of the Chosun governor's office. However, restoration work has already been completed thanks to the restoration project such as demolishing the governor's building from the 1990s. Kunjeongjeon, Gyeonghoeru, Baejwonjeong, Amisan chimneys remain untouched. The area is 432,703m2, and it is 500m east-west and 700m north-south.
Imjinwaeran played an important role in the court of the Joseon Dynasty during the previous Joseon Dynasty. Gyeongbokgung has been designed with strict geometric spatial division, straight axis building arrangement, and square symmetrical structure to express authority as a courtroom. The Changdeokgung (+ Changgyeonggung) and Yanggyeonggwang system were used, and the wagons used the two palaces alternately according to their preference. After being destroyed during the Japanese invasion of Korea, it was tied up with a ban on the spot and rebuilt for 200 years. For reference, Gyeongbok Palace built by Heungseon Daewongun and Gyeongbokgung, which was destroyed during the Imjin War, differ naturally.
If you take care of your anxious and honorable and fearful minds and enjoy the blessings of the ancestors, your saints and grandchildren will inherit and tell you ten million.
